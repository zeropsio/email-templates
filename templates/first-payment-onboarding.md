[//]: # (Thank you for the verification payment to Zerops!)

Hello there! While this is an automated message, believe me, I'm personally thankful for your verification payment to Zerops. We've added an additional ${{ .PromoCreditBonus }} in promo credits to your organization. 

I would love to hear what you're building and help you set it up on Zerops, optimize the deployment process, or answer any questions regarding Zerops in general. Feel free to send me an email at ales@zerops.io or, better yet, join our Discord server ([https://discord.gg/zeropsio](https://discord.gg/zeropsio)) where our whole dev team is happy to discuss anything.
