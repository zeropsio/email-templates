[//]: # (Thank you for the verification payment to Zerops!)

<div style="max-width: 1000px;">

Hello there! While this is an automated message, believe me, I'm personally thankful for your first payment to Zerops. An additional ${{ .PromoCreditBonus }} in promo credits has been added to your organization.

The team and I would love to hear what you're building and help you optimally set it up on Zerops, or answer any question about the platform. Feel free to send me an email at ales@zerops.io or, better yet, join our Discord server ([https://discord.gg/zeropsio](https://discord.gg/zeropsio)) where our whole dev team hangs out.

Aleš  
CEO / developer
